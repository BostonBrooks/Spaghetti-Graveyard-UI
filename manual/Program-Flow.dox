/** \page Program-Flow

An outline of the basic flow of the program (main.c) follows:

-Open map header file and read map settings inc filenames 
-Load textures from filename
-Load sprites from filename
-Load animations from filename
-Open window and display loading screen
-Load Skin data

-Initialise VTables and their elements (preferably on a per-map basis)
    - Avoidance shape functions
    - AI constructors
    - AI OnUpdate
    - AI OnCommand
    - Drawable constructors
    - Renderers, Shaders
    - Draw functions for drawables/animations
    - Messages (to drawables)

-Load Terrain data, lighting or whatever else

-If the settings indicate a curved ground surface,
    - load ground surface from file.
    - calculate ground shading.
    This can be slow, so the first map loaded should have 
    a flat ground surface to facilitate fast loading.
   
-Initialise bbDrawableSquares

-Initialise Pools

-Load Widgets
    -one widget should be selected to handle text input (the prompt)
    -one widget should be selected as root (the decal)
    -one widget should be selected as the current spell.
    (as spell is a type of widget, that is represented by it's "click to activate" icon)
-Load static Drawables
-Load AI_SFMs with their own Drawables
- Spawn player (go between input parser and player FSM), player FSM, player drawable
-Initialise viewport

-Begin main loop:

    -Draw viewport.
    -Draw widgets.
    -Parse input
         - Send mouse movements/clicks to widgets
         - If no widget clicked, send mouse clicks to viewport
         - Send key presses to prompt
    -Player object takes Parsed input and modifies player FSM
    //-May want to do some internet stuff
    -Update AI_FSMs and send a list of commands to drawables
    -Go though list and modify drawables
    -Increment map time, global time

-If player indicates to load a different map, clear graphics data including ground surface, and load new map as seen at the top of the page.
(I do not know what I will do about data shared between maps such as player stats)
