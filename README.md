# Spaghetti-Graveyard-UI
This repository contains experimental code the will inform the user interface of the final project

Spaghetti Graveyard Zero will be the third iteration of a project I started around the year 2018.
The project is an action RPG game that quizes you on mathematics skills (numeracy).

Spaghetti - Because I did not know much about how write well structured code at the start of this project.
Graveyard - Because since learning how to write better code, I have discarded much of the code that I had written.
Zero      - Because this is intended to the first iteration that is intended for public viewing.


Since this code is intended for public viewing, I will strive for the code to be of production quality.
As a starting point I will develop the documentation using Doxygen before implementing any functioning code.
Code will be written in the C language and attempt acheive some object oriented functionality through "clever hacks".
